This project is an automated testing framework based on the Cucumber framework, designed to enhance behavior-driven development (BDD) testing. It enables clear communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders by using Gherkin syntax to define test scenarios in a human-readable format. The framework integrates with Selenium WebDriver for UI testing, JUnit/TestNG for test execution, and Maven for dependency management.

Key Features
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): Uses Gherkin language (Given-When-Then) to write test scenarios for better clarity and collaboration.

Selenium WebDriver Integration: Automates web application testing by interacting with UI elements.

Page Object Model (POM): Implements a structured approach to maintain test scripts and improve reusability.

Parameterized Testing: Supports data-driven testing with examples in Gherkin feature files or external sources like Excel/CSV.

Parallel Execution: Uses Cucumber options and TestNG to run tests concurrently for faster execution.

Reporting & Logging: Generates detailed Cucumber HTML reports and integrates with logging frameworks like Log4j for debugging.

Cross-Browser Testing: Compatible with multiple browsers using WebDriver configurations.

CI/CD Integration: Easily integrates with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD pipelines for automated test execution.
